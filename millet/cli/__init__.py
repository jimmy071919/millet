"""CLI entrypoint for the millet tool.

Commands:
    millet record          - Record meeting audio (Ctrl+C to stop)
    millet transcribe FILE - Transcribe a recorded audio file
    millet run             - Record then transcribe when stopped
    millet gui             - Launch GUI widget for recording
    millet devices         - List available audio devices
    millet check           - Check system prerequisites
    millet download        - Download alignment models
    millet translate       - Translate a session's transcript
    millet label           - Assign real names to speakers in a session

v0.10.0: this was a single 1929-line ``cli.py`` module; it is now a
``cli/`` package with one module per command + a shared ``_helpers``
module.  The command symbols are re-exported here so the
``millet.subcommands`` / ``meet.subcommands`` entry points
(``millet.cli:transcribe`` etc.) keep resolving.
